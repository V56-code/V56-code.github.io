  <h1>The Future of AI</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most influential technologies of our time. From automation to advanced analytics, AI is reshaping industries across the world.</p>

  <p>This article explores the core concepts of AI, current developments, and future trends. The goal here is not to provide a fully detailed study but to create content that will later be used for SEO experiments such as On-Page SEO, Social Bookmarking, Directory Submission, and Article Submission.</p>

  <p>In future updates, this post will be optimized using meta tags, keyword placement, image alt text, and internal linking as part of the Digital Marketing lab experiments.</p>
