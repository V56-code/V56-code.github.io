  <main>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>My Tech Blog</strong> — a digital space created as part of my B.Tech Digital Marketing Lab course. Here, I share insights and experiments related to technology, coding, and online marketing.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is to learn by doing — applying real digital marketing techniques such as SEO, content creation, analytics, and social promotions on a live project.</p>

    <p>This page and others will evolve over time as new experiments are completed. For now, this site serves as the foundation for understanding website development and online visibility.</p>
