# 🌐 My Tech Blog – Digital Marketing Lab Project

Welcome to **My Tech Blog**, a live website created as part of my **B.Tech Digital Marketing Open Elective**.  
This project serves as a practical foundation for performing all lab experiments related to **Digital Marketing**, including **On-Page SEO**, **Off-Page SEO**, **Social Bookmarking**, **Content Marketing**, **Analytics**, and more.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This website is designed as a **tech-focused blog** where I publish articles related to:
- Emerging technologies

The primary goal is to **learn digital marketing by doing** — applying real-world techniques on a functional website instead of simulations.
